                    <p>Our team has built a Heart Track application for monitoring heart rate and blood oxygen saturation level throughout the day of a user. We utilize a IoT device that connects to our web server to convey data of a user's health in a graph format. Our web application allows a user to define the time of day range and frequency at which measurements will be requested. We utilize a weekly and daily summary view for our measurements to allow a user to have a more general view (weekly) of their health measurements, or a more specific view (daily).  We combine HTML, JS, and CSS concepts we learned in class to create the website for our web application. Along with this, we implemented a MongoDB database to store measurements and account information. We hope you enjoy our project and stay healthy! </p>
