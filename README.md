## **Project Description**  
The Heart Track application is a cost-effective, IoT-enabled web app designed for continuous monitoring of heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels. Measurements are taken at intervals specified by the user or physician.  

An IoT device equipped with heart rate and oxygen sensors periodically reminds users to record their measurements. These measurements are then transmitted to a web application where users or physicians can easily access and analyze the data.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Configurable Measurement Schedule**: Users or physicians can define the time of day and frequency for measurements.  
- **Seamless Monitoring**: The web app provides a clear and intuitive interface for tracking heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels.  
- **Responsive Design**: The application is optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth user experience across platforms.
